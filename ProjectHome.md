A simple application to set up an environment that will allow Moppy (by Sammy1Am) to run on Mac.

This app checks for and supplies specific libraries and permissions needed to run the Moppy project on Mac. This project should run on all Macs (PPC, x86, x86\_64, all Mac versions) but has only been tested on x86\_64.

HUGE thanks for the RXTX libraries go to http://blog.iharder.net/2009/08/18/rxtx-java-6-and-librxtxserial-jnilib-on-intel-mac-os-x/ for compiling librxtxSerial.jnilib for PPC, x86 and x86\_64 on Mac.
